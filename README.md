# Horn_and_Schunck_Python_Implementation

Here I have tried to implement the Horn and Schunck method of prediction of movement of an image (from image 1 to image 2). I have borrowed help in implementation from [Imiz100](https://github.com/lmiz100/Optical-flow-Horn-Schunck-method/blob/master/MyHornSchunck.py).
