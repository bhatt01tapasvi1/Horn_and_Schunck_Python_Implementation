# Horn_and_Schunck_Python_Implementation

Here I have tried to implement the Horn and Schunck method of prediction of movement of an image (from image 1 to image 2). I have borrowed help in implementation from [Imiz100](https://github.com/lmiz100/Optical-flow-Horn-Schunck-method/blob/master/MyHornSchunck.py).

You have to upload two files: "image1.png" and "image2.png"; preferably keeping the name of the files same without the quotes if you don't wanna change the occurance of this in the complete codebase. The output will be two images: one in red, with high density of the particle motion arrows, and other in blue, with low density of particle motion arrows and bigger arrow heads for better clarity.
